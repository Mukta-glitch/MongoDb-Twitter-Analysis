Concept-

MongoDB is a relational database used in Big Data Applications. File is stored in JSON format.
MongoDB provides faster updates and results. It is quick in query processing and provides high 
scaling applications. It uses Collection, document and indexing. It uses Sharding which is 
basically division of a single database into multiple servers which result in faster processing.

Collection-
It is a catalogue of documents. These documents may be related or unrelated within
the database. Each MongoDB server contains multiple databases which contains Collection.
Syntax-db. createCollection (nameofcollection, memory size/indexing)

Document-
It is a combination of key->Value Pair.Fields in document may or may not be related 
to each other.
Syntax-db.nameofcollection.insert(document)

Indexing-
Using indexing the search results are optimized, the document is scanned at a faster 
pace and document is retrieved.
Syntax- db. nameofcollection. createIndex({key:1})

LIKE â€“
1.Useful for bigdata applications.
2.limit function can be used to limit the retrieved number of documents.
3.Timestamp function will store creation time of the documents, and if ObjectID function is 
used it will automatically save the timestamp while creating a unique ID.
4.Aggregation functions are used in MongoDB such as sum, avg , min , max , push , first , last.

DISLIKE-
1.Documents in MongoDB are very difficult to update and sometimes may result in data loss or 
corrupt data.
2.Does not support relational database as it uses Multi document Atomicity, Consistency , 
Isolation, Durability.
3.One main issue of MongoDB is data duplication as data handling becomes tedious job.
4.Memory usage in MongoDB is very High and requires a lot of space. Example -Data 
Duplication.
