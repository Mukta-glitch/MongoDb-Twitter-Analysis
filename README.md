The keyword used by me is ‘Navratri’ a recent Hindu festival.
In my search results I observed that most of the words were in Hindi, also some words did not 
have any context such as names of people. The search results could have been more refined if 
more data such as mentioning, ‘Garba’, ‘Dandiya’ which are the dance forms played during this 
festival could have improved the research. Also, by refining the location to Maharashtra,
Gujarat search results could have been more precise
